# Global Economic and Demographic Trends Analysis
## Overview

This project analyzes global economic, demographic, and health-related datasets to generate meaningful insights using Power BI. Data from multiple sources (Excel and SQL) is integrated, cleaned, transformed, and visualized to create an interactive dashboard that highlights trends across countries and regions.

## Objectives

Compare GDP and economic performance across countries and regions

Explore relationships between economic indicators and health outcomes

Present insights through interactive Power BI dashboards

## Data Sources

The project uses four datasets:

Dataset	Source	Description
Population Data	Excel	Country-wise population statistics
GDP Data	Excel	GDP and economic indicators
Country Characteristics	SQL	Region, income group, classifications
Health Indicators	SQL / Excel	Life expectancy and health metrics
