### Global Economic and Demographic Trends Analysis

Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze and derive meaningful insights from global economic, demographic, and health-related datasets. The analysis integrates data from multiple sources, including Excel files and a SQL database, to provide a holistic view of population trends, GDP performance, country characteristics, and health indicators across countries.

Using Power BI, the project focuses on data integration, cleaning, transformation, descriptive analysis, and visualization. The final outcome is an interactive dashboard that supports data-driven decision-making by highlighting key global trends and patterns.

Business Objectives

Understand global population and demographic trends

Analyze GDP growth and economic performance across countries
